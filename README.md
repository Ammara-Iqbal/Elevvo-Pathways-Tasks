Elevvo Pathways Internship Projects

This repository contains three machine learning projects completed during the Elevvo Pathways Internship program. Each project demonstrates end-to-end implementation of data science workflows, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

üìå Projects Overview
1. Student Score Prediction

Objective:
Predict students' academic performance (scores) based on demographic, study-related, and lifestyle features.

Steps Implemented:

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Feature engineering

Regression model training (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)

Model evaluation using RMSE, MAE, and R¬≤

Visualization of feature importance and predictions

Key Outcome:
Built a predictive model that estimates student performance with strong generalization ability.

2. Customer Segmentation

Objective:
Cluster customers into meaningful groups based on purchasing behavior and demographics for targeted marketing.

Steps Implemented:

Data preprocessing (handling missing values, scaling, encoding)

Exploratory data analysis

Dimensionality reduction with PCA

Clustering using K-Means and Hierarchical clustering

Evaluation using silhouette score and Davies-Bouldin index

Visualizing customer clusters in 2D space

Key Outcome:
Identified distinct customer groups, providing actionable insights for personalized marketing strategies.

3. Forest Cover Type Classification

Objective:
Classify the type of forest cover (7 classes) based on cartographic and environmental features from the UCI Covertype dataset.

Steps Implemented:

Large dataset preprocessing (581,012 rows √ó 54 features)

Train/validation/test split

Training baseline models (Random Forest, XGBoost)

Hyperparameter tuning

Evaluation with accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

Feature importance visualization

Key Outcome:
Achieved high accuracy in classifying forest cover types, demonstrating scalability of ML models on large datasets.
